# Transformer Model from Scratch Optimized by Genetic Algorithms for Stock Market Prediction

![Transformer Structure](assets/transformer_structure.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Transformer model from scratch**, meaning it does not rely on the PyTorch API for Transformers. Instead, it is entirely custom-built and designed for time series prediction, specifically for forecasting stock market prices.

Additionally, this project includes an enhanced version of the Transformer, `Transformer_GA.py`, which integrates **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to optimize hyperparameters dynamically.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository contains the following key components:

- **`Transformer_GA.py`** → Implements the Transformer model with Genetic Algorithms for hyperparameter tuning.
- **`Transformer_s_time_series_1.py`** → Standard Transformer model for time series prediction.
- **`datasets/`** → Contains the stock market data used for training and evaluation.
- **`best_model_weights/`** → Stores the best-trained model weights.
- **`plots.py`** → Generates visualizations of model predictions vs. ground truth (GT).
- **`stats/`** → Stores evaluation metrics and statistics.
- **`assets/`** → Contains images used in the README.

## ⚠️ **Important Notice: Training Required**
The trained model weights have been **removed** due to file size limitations. If you want to test the model, you must first **retrain it**.
(🚨 Create transformer and transformer_GA folders inside ---> best_model_weights before training 🚨)

There are **two ways to train the model**:

1️⃣ **Standard Transformer Training** 
- Run `Transformer_s_time_series_1.py` to train the model. 
- Before running, set the `--train` flag to `True` inside `args.py`. 
- If `--train` is set to `False`, the script will attempt to test the model, but it will fail due to missing trained weights.

2️⃣ **Optimized Training with Genetic Algorithms (GA)** 
- Run `Transformer_GA.py` for a more **robust training process** using **Genetic Algorithms** to find the best hyperparameters. 
- Simply execute the script or run it from the terminal.

🚨 **Using Custom Datasets:** 
If you want to train the model on a different dataset: 
- You need to download a new dataset from **Yahoo Finance**. 
- The `preprocessing.py` script provides tools for downloading and preprocessing stock data for time series. 
- However, **preprocessing time series data requires advanced knowledge**. The script includes complex arguments that may not be intuitive for beginners in data processing.

As shown, the model effectively captures the stock market trend with minimal deviation from real values.
