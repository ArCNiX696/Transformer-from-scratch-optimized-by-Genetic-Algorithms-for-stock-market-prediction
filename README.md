# Transformer Model from Scratch Optimized by Genetic Algorithms for Stock Market Prediction

![Transformer Structure](assets/transformer_structure.png)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a **Transformer model from scratch**, meaning it does not rely on the PyTorch API for Transformers. Instead, it is entirely custom-built and designed for time series prediction, specifically for forecasting stock market prices.

Additionally, this project includes an enhanced version of the Transformer, `Transformer_GA.py`, which integrates **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to optimize hyperparameters dynamically.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The repository contains the following key components:

- **`Transformer_GA.py`** â†’ Implements the Transformer model with Genetic Algorithms for hyperparameter tuning.
- **`Transformer_s_time_series_1.py`** â†’ Standard Transformer model for time series prediction.
- **`datasets/`** â†’ Contains the stock market data used for training and evaluation.
- **`best_model_weights/`** â†’ Stores the best-trained model weights.
- **`plots.py`** â†’ Generates visualizations of model predictions vs. ground truth (GT).
- **`stats/`** â†’ Stores evaluation metrics and statistics.
- **`assets/`** â†’ Contains images used in the README.
